## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm**: Node package manager (comes with Node.js).

### 1. Clone the repository

Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-estate-website.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory

Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd real-estate-website
```

### 3. Install dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the required packages listed in `package.json`.

### 4. Set up Web3Forms API Key

The project uses Web3Forms to handle form submissions. You will need to set up an API key to use this service.

1. Go to [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com/) and sign up for an account.
2. After logging in, go to the **API** section and copy your **API Key**.
3. In the project, open the `src/assets/assets.js` file and replace the existing API key with your new one.

```javascript
// Example in assets.js
const formData = new FormData(event.target);
formData.append("access_key", "your-api-key-here");
```

### 5. Run the development server

Once the dependencies are installed and the API key is set, run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server. You can view the website in your browser by navigating to:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

### 6. Build for Production

To create a production build of the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist` folder with the optimized production build.

### 7. Deploying the Website

Once you have the production build, you can deploy the website to any hosting platform. Some popular options include:

- **Vercel**: [Vercel Deployment](https://vercel.com/)
- **GitHub Pages**: [GitHub Pages Deployment](https://pages.github.com/)

## Folder Structure

The project folder structure is as follows:

```
/real-estate-website
├── /assets           # Contains all static assets like images, logos, etc.
├── /components       # Contains all React components (Header, Footer, etc.)
├── /pages            # Contains all pages (Home, About, Contact, etc.)
├── /public           # Public assets (index.html, etc.)
├── /src              # Main source code
├── /node_modules     # Node modules (installed dependencies)
├── package.json      # Project metadata and dependencies
├── tailwind.config.js # TailwindCSS configuration
└── vite.config.js    # Vite configuration
```

## TailwindCSS Setup

TailwindCSS is set up using the PostCSS configuration provided by Vite. The `tailwind.config.js` file contains the configuration for custom colors, fonts, and other utilities.

### Customizing TailwindCSS

You can customize the theme by editing the `tailwind.config.js` file. For example, you can add custom colors, spacing, or breakpoints:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: "#1D4ED8", // Custom blue color
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

### Steps to Contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.
